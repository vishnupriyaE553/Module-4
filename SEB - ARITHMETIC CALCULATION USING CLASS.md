## SEB - ARITHMETIC CALCULATION USING CLASS

### AIM  
To write a Python program to perform addition and division operations using a class. The class should be named Saveetha, and the function names should be setvalues (to set a and b values), add, and div. The program should handle the following cases:
- `choice 1` → Perform addition  
- `choice 2` → Perform division  
- `choice 0` → Exit  
- For other choices, print 'Invalid choice'

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2.Define a class cse with an __init__ method to initialize two numbers a and b.
3. Define a method mod() to return the modulus of a and b.
4. Define a method div() to return the floor division of a by b.
5. Read two integer inputs from the user and create an object obj of the cse class.
6. Initialize choice as 1 and use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a choice.
7. If choice == 1, display the modulus result; if choice == 2, display the division result; otherwise, print "Exiting!".
8. Terminate the program.

Name: Vishnu priya E

class cse:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a=a
        self.b=b
    def mod(self):
        return self.a%self.b
    def div(self):
        return self.a//self.b

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
obj=cse(a, b)
obj.mod()
obj.div()
choice=1
while choice!=0:
    choice=int(input())
    if choice==1:
        print("Result: ", obj.mod())
    elif choice==2:
        print("Result: ", obj.div())
    else:
        print("Exiting!")

print()
```
